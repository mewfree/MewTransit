#+title: MewTransit

* Introduction
My very own public transit app.

Focusing on Montreal for now.

* Tasks / Plan
- Going to try reading GTFS files locally, unzipped for now (and converted to JSON for ease of use...)

* GTFS gotchas
- List of routes in ~routes.txt~
- List of trips in ~trips.txt~ (with ~route_id~)
- List of stop times in ~stop_times.txt~ (with ~trip_id~)

* How to run?
- ~npx expo start~ (with ~--clear~ to clear cache)

* How to debug?
- Tap ~cmd+D~ in iOS Simulator

* How to build?
- Android: ~eas build --platform android~
- iOS: ~eas build --platform ios~
